***********************************************************************
           N.B.: turn down the volume with these experiments!
         Serious risk of blowing up speakers or damaging your ears.
          Best played in combination with visual representation.

Prerequisites:
- libfftw - C library for discrete Fourier transform in one or more dimensions
  http://fftw.org
- MFFM FFTw C++ wrapper
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mffmfftwrapper
- libsndfile - sound file reading and creation
  http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile

For Ubuntu and other Debian derivatives:
install libfftw3-dev, mffm-fftw-dev and libsndfile1-dev

The main file ffft.cpp is compiled by typing 'make'. If you installed the
mentioned prerequisites this should build the executable ffft

Call the program with two filenames on the command line: a file for input
and a file for output. The number of channels of the input file can be
greater than one. The program uses only the first channel and produces a
mono output file.

The unmodified program returns the original audio signal. This is useful
for testing.

When modifying the program, be sure you visually check the resulting sound
file before playing it and play at low volume. These spectral tricks can
result in accumulation of energy at certain points in the fragment.
